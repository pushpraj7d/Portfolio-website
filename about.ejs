    <h2>Hello, I'm Pushpraj</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a 3rd-year computer science student passionate about machine learning, full-stack development, and building impactful projects. I have experience working with various technologies including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, and machine learning libraries like TensorFlow and Keras. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I am currently working on several projects, including a Deep Fake Detection System utilizing advanced techniques like BlazeFace and ResNext. Additionally, I’ve developed a Python-based Slot Machine game that simulates real-world mechanics.
    </p>
    <p>
      I enjoy solving real-world problems through technology, and I’m always eager to learn and improve my skills.
